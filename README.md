# This repository is for web scraping projects using Python.

I first learned how to do this in an Intermediate Python course at the University of Alabama. 
This course mainly used Jupyter Notebook, so those files in here were class projects. 
Since then, I have become interested in web scraping, so I created this repository for my personal projects.
